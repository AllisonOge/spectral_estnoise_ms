# spectral_estnoise_ms

Spectral noise estimation using minimum statistics project research was a proposed method for noise estimation in noisy speech signals which is used for the development of voice activity detectors (VADs). In this research, the implementation of the algorithm is developed in python 3 and tested for quality and code validation. Thereafter the nuanced version of the implementation is compared with exiting noise estimation methods proposed by ITU for spectral occupancy measurement. The expectation of the development is that the nuanced version proposed by this research should outperform the existing methodologies and compensate their drawbacks.

## Outstanding tasks
- [ ] Correct bugs in code to improve the noise estimate results in the time domain as well as the MMSE values
- [ ] Test nuanced version on FM and mobile signal measurement
- [ ] Develop the python code for the 80% method
